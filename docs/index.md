### Legal Disclaimer

This coin is ONLY FOR DECORATIONAL PURPOSES and should not be considered an investment of any form. It has literally no features of any kind besides being an ERC20 token. I literally found the sample code on a random website. I am not responsible for any financial damage caused by this coin. Do not actually give me money unless you don't want it anymore. Warranty void if exposed to air. 

### ICO 

So I don't actually have enough ethereum to deploy the smart contract for this token anywhere besides the Ropsten testnet (which you can check out at https://ropsten.etherscan.io/token/0x2491c96e0959a497823b195a52c3d28f13585043). Any donations at 0x23d349a1801B56457C82F009B6B79D3391f5a2c8 would be appreciated and supporters will recieve anywhere ranging from 0 to 1 quadrillion Werewolf Girl Coins, picked randomly, if we ever get enough ETH to fund the contract (please be sensible and do not actually waste your money on this project).
